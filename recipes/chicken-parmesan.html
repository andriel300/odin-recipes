            <h1>Top Tips for Making Chicken Parmesan</h1>
            <p>
                Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making
                the best baked Chicken Parmesan:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <strong><li>Pound Chicken to an even thickness</li></strong>
                <p>
                    Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so
                    they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part
                    down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.
                </p>
                <strong><li>Don't skimp on seasoning</li></strong>
                <p>
                    Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with
                    salting the flour and bread crumbs.
                </p>
                <strong><li>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs</li></strong>
                <p>
                    Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated
                    Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the
                    Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.
                </p>
                <strong><li>Rest before cooking</li></strong>
                <p>
                    Before frying, let the Breaded chicken sit on the counter
                    for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the
                    chicken breast.
                </p>
                <strong><li>Go easy on the sauce</li></strong>
                <p>
                    THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in
                    sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is
                    too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why
                    make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?
                </p>
                <strong><li>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot</li></strong>
                <p>
                    Be sure your oven is <em>completely</em> preheated to 450 F.
                    You'll want the cheese brown slightly and the breading to
                    crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot
                    oven is the way to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now find out <u>the best wine to pair</u> with your
                    non-soggy, not-too-saucy baked Chicken Parmesan. Enjoy!
                </p>

        <h2>Steps Directions</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: none">
            <strong>
                <li>Step 1</li>
            </strong>
            <p>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
            <strong>
                <li>Step 2</li>
            </strong>
            <p>
                Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic
                (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface.
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a
                thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and
                pepper.
            </p>
            <strong>
                <li>Step 3</li>
            </strong>
            <p>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</p>
            <strong>
                <li>Step 4</li>
            </strong>
            <p>
                Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl,
                set aside.
            </p>
            <strong>
                <li>Step 5</li>
            </strong>
            <p>
                Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken
                breasts, evenly coating both sides.
            </p>
            <strong>
                <li>Step 6</li>
            </strong>
            <p>
                Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer
                breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both
                sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15
                minutes.
            </p>
            <strong>
                <li>Step 7</li>
            </strong>
            <p>
                Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat
                until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until
                golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish
                cooking in the oven.
            </p>
            <strong>
                <li>Step 8</li>
            </strong>
            <p>
                Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2
                tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal
                amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese.
                Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2
                teaspoon olive oil.
            </p>
            <strong>
                <li>Step 9</li>
            </strong>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly
                and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20
                minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
                should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
