        <h1>Top Tips for Making Chicken Parmesan</h1>
        <p>
            Before we get to the recipe, here's your cheat sheet for making the
            best baked Chicken Parmesan:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>Pound Chicken to an even thickness</li></strong>
            <p>
                Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they
                cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to
                the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.
            </p>
            <strong><li>Don't skimp on seasoning</li></strong>
            <p>
                Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting
                the flour and bread crumbs.
            </p>
            <strong><li>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs</li></strong>
            <p>
                Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated
                Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan
                will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.
            </p>
            <strong><li>Rest before cooking</li></strong>
            <p>
                Before frying, let the Breaded chicken sit on the counter for
                about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken
                breast.
            </p>
            <strong><li>Go easy on the sauce</li></strong>
            <p>
                THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce
                and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much.
                You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy
                with too much sauce and cheese?
            </p>
            <strong><li>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot</li></strong>
            <p>
                Be sure your oven is <em>completely</em> preheated to 450 F.
                You'll want the cheese brown slightly and the breading to crisp
                up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is
                the way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now find out <u>the best wine to pair</u> with your non-soggy,
                not-too-saucy baked Chicken Parmesan. Enjoy!
